## Executive Summary

Martha is an AI-powered field assistant system designed specifically for senior engineers working in industrial environments. The system provides intelligent capture, processing, and management of field operations data including inspections, maintenance activities, safety incidents, and team coordination.

### Problem Statement

Senior engineers in industrial settings face several critical challenges:
- **Information Fragmentation**: Field observations scattered across notebooks, photos, voice memos, and various digital tools
- **Manual Processing Overhead**: Significant time spent converting raw field data into actionable tasks
- **Context Loss**: Important details forgotten or buried in unstructured notes
- **Priority Management**: Difficulty maintaining overview of critical vs. routine tasks
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Field expertise trapped in individual workflows rather than systematically captured

### Solution Overview

Martha addresses these challenges through:
1. **Unified Capture Interface**: Single system for all field observations (video, audio, photos, text)
2. **AI-Powered Processing**: Intelligent extraction of action items, priorities, and structured data
3. **Smart Organization**: Automatic categorization and priority-based task management
4. **Persistent Memory**: Long-term knowledge repository with efficient retrieval
