# Contributing to Martha

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Martha as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code with appropriate comments
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functions and components
- Write integration tests for complex workflows
- Test user interactions and edge cases
- Aim for high test coverage but prioritize meaningful tests

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/karstegg/martha-assistant-system/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Provide a clear description of the problem you're trying to solve
3. Explain why this feature would be useful to Martha users
4. Consider whether this fits with the project's scope and goals
